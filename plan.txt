Essentially a local agent that runs on your machine, uses MCP for Gmail/Calendar access, stores everything in a local vector DB for semantic search, and runs scheduled jobs for briefings and follow-up tracking. Here's how the pieces fit together:
The Core Loop
Your local agent (built with Claude Code or a Python script orchestrating Haiku via the API) acts as the brain. It connects to Gmail MCP to watch for new emails, processes each one through Haiku for sentiment, intent, priority, and entity extraction, then writes the results back as Gmail labels/stars and simultaneously embeds the email into a local vector store like ChromaDB or LanceDB. Everything lives on your machine.
The Processing Layer
When an email arrives, it flows through a lightweight pipeline:
Email in → Haiku analyzes (sentiment, intent, priority, entities, summary) → results get written three places: back to Gmail as labels, into the vector DB with metadata, and into a simple local SQLite database for structured tracking (contact sentiment over time, pending follow-ups, deadlines).
The Search Layer
The vector store gives you natural language search across your entire email history. Instead of Gmail's keyword search, you ask "that thread about the budget dispute with the vendor in Q2" and it finds it semantically. ChromaDB runs entirely locally, zero external dependencies.
The Briefing Layer
A cron job (or just a scheduled Python task) runs each morning. It queries the SQLite DB and vector store, passes the results through Haiku, and generates your daily briefing — urgent items, overnight activity, follow-ups due, sentiment shifts. This could output as a markdown file, a Slack message to yourself, or even an email to your own inbox.
The Interaction Layer
When you want to engage on-demand, you talk to the agent directly — "summarize my unread," "draft a reply to Sarah's last email," "what's the status of the Acme project." It pulls context from the vector store and Gmail MCP, uses Haiku to generate responses, and can push drafts back into Gmail.
Tech Stack Summary

Orchestration: Python script or Claude Code agent
Email access: Gmail MCP server
Calendar access: Google Calendar MCP server
Intelligence: Haiku API (cheap and fast enough to run on every email)
Vector search: ChromaDB or LanceDB (local, no server needed)
Structured data: SQLite (follow-ups, contact sentiment history, deadlines)
Scheduling: cron or APScheduler for daily briefings
Interface: CLI, or a simple local web UI if you want something visual

The beauty of this setup is that it starts simple — you can get the basic MCP + Haiku labeling loop working in an afternoon — and every other piece (vector search, briefings, draft generation) layers on incrementally without rearchitecting anything.

# New ideas

Bulk Declutter (the big win)

Auto-unsubscribe pipeline — detect newsletters/marketing emails, extract the unsubscribe link, and either auto-click it or queue them for one-click batch approval. Years of accumulated subscriptions gone in an afternoon.
Sender reputation scoring — after processing your history, rank every sender by how often their emails led to any action from you. The bottom 80% are probably clutter you never needed.
Safe-to-delete buckets — automatically identify emails that are purely transactional and past their useful life (shipping notifications from 2019, OTP codes, event invites that already passed) and batch-archive or delete them.

Making Sense of the Chaos

Auto-categorize by life domain — Finance, Health, Travel, Shopping, Family, Work, Government/Legal, Subscriptions, etc. Not Gmail's generic tabs, but your actual life inferred from content.
Highlight emails you should have replied to and didn't — years of dropped threads you may have forgotten about.
Find all accounts you have — synthesize a list of every service/website you've ever signed up for based on welcome emails, receipts, and password resets. Useful for knowing what to delete or secure.

Surfacing Things That Still Matter

Active subscriptions and recurring charges — pull every billing confirmation and map out what you're apparently still paying for.
Credentials and account info buried in old emails — flag emails containing account numbers, policy numbers, reference numbers so you can actually find them when needed.
Warranties and receipts — extract purchase dates, products, and retailers into a simple list so you know what's still under warranty.
Important people you've lost touch with — find real human emails (not automated) from people you haven't heard from in years.

Ongoing Maintenance (once it's clean)

New sender classification on arrival — the moment a new sender appears, immediately decide if it's a human, a service you use, or marketing, and route accordingly before it contributes to future chaos.
Weekly clutter report — "47 emails arrived, 31 were auto-archived, here's what's left."


The single highest-value thing for a chaotic personal inbox is probably the sender scoring + safe-to-delete identification — most of those thousands of emails are from senders whose entire history with you is noise. Identifying and purging those in bulk would cut the problem down dramatically before doing anything else.
